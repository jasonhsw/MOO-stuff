The heartbeat system periodically calls heartbeat verbs on registered objects.

Note: I wrote this heartbeat system for a version of LambdaMOO with the sub-second fork/suspend patch installed.
This system depends on my logger object for logging, the traceback handler for reporting errors, and the table verb in string_utils.moo for displaying log data.

Install heart.moo. This will create the heart and corify it for you.
Then, add two properties to the objects that you want to put heartbeat verbs on,, or create a special object to hold these properties' and chparent objects to this new object.
@prop object.heart_queue 0 ""
@prop object.last_heartbeat_time 0 "rc"
Call $heart:run() to start the heart.
Optionally, add a call to $heart:server_started to #0:server_started.
